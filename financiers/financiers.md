Small almond cakes flavoured with brown butter and topped with flaked almonds or fruit.

Makes 12 slightly more than bitesize cakes.

## Ingredients
- Plain Flour | 50g
- Ground Almond | 60g
- Icing Sugar | 150g
- Egg Whites | 3 | Medium
- Butter | 150g | Unsalted
- Salt | 1/8 tsp
- Toppings of your choice (flaked almonds/pear/raspberry/dark choc)


## Prep
Preheat oven to 200°C
> We'll turn it down when it goes in

Grease a muffin tray


## Brown butter
Put the butter in a cold pan and turn the heat to high.

Once the butter starts to get hot keep it moving by swishing the pan so it doesnt burn.

Butter will start to boil. Listen to the sound.
First it will hiss.
Then it will crackle.
Then the crackling will die down.

When the crackling dies down, remove from the heat.

Wait until butter has cooled. Proceed when it has reached 40-45°C.


## Batter
Add the ground almond to a bowl and sift in the flour and icing sugar. Add salt. Mix.

Make a well in the centre and add the egg white.

Using a spatula, stir the egg white, allowing the dry ingredients to slowly incorporate themselves.

When there's still a bit left unmixed, start adding the butter a little at a time to the centre, continuing to stir until everything is blended.

(Optional) Cling film and rest in fridge 1 hour. (I never did this)

Distribute the batter through the muffin tin. It won't be much.

Add toppings.

## Oven
Turn heat down when you put the tray in.
Bake at 180°C Fan for 12 minutes.
You're looking for golden brown colour and a knife to come out clean.

Remove to a cooling rack immediately. If you can flip it over and they come out then great, otherwise run a knife around the sides and dig them out with a spoon or something.





## Notes
Almond and brown butter are delicate flavours and easily overpowered.
In particular the chocolate completely took over the taste. I wouldnt use it again.
The pear was nice and I would have it again but I liked the ones topped with sliced dry roasted almonds best.

I'm unsure as to how much salt I used as I kinda just threw some in at the end.
Recipe should be updated with a tested amount.

Cooking time - i'm not certain on the time and temp i used.
Original recipe calls for first 5 mins at 200 non-fan then another 10 at 180.
ATK recipe calls for 14 mins at 190 non-fan.
Hanbit's called for preheat to 200 then bake 180 for 10 mins even though his were bigger.

Hanbit's recipe has some interesting modifications I haven't tried.
    0.5g baking powder for lighter texture and rise.
    Uses honey (perhaps would have to reduce sugar)
    Vanilla powder (getting it powdered seems like a pain)
