The biggest mental obstacles seem to be that I can't figure out the best way to structure the recipes yet and I don't know how I'm going to display, organise and browse them.

I think the solution is to get only a couple of recipes written up and then move to making a working interface. If I can start using the system for real then I won't have to worry that any effort spent typing up recipes will be wasted -- I'll already be using it.

This static site generator stuff? Hugo?

Don't know what to do about folder names. Perhaps they should be auto generated from the recipe metadata, or specified therein.

Tags are often displayed in a cloud where the size/colour is scaled by the number of times they have been used.

Perhaps recipe can specify a 'main' picture that's intended to be the main thumbnail when browsing recipes.

Need to figure out how to organise sources
I should probably have a list of sources that i cite from instead of doing it from scratch in every file
